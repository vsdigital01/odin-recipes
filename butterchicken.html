    <h1>Indian Butter Chicken</h1>
    <img src="img/butterchicken.jpg" alt="Creamy Butter Chicken"> <!--https://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/indian_butter_chicken/ -->

 <h2>Butter Chicken simmers in a buttery tomato sauce and is punctuated by several
   special spices and herbs. Skip the Indian takeout and cook up your very own version
   of the popular dish!</h2>

  <h4><p>Butter chicken is prepared with marinated chicken that's first grilled and
    then served in a rich gravy (a.k.a. curry) made with tomato, butter, and a
    special spice blend as a base.</p>
    <p>Unlike most Indian curries where the preparation of the base starts with a
    blend of onion and a ginger garlic paste cooked in oil, butter chicken uses
    tomato as a base and is cooked in butter, giving it a slightly sweet flavor.
    Cashews and almonds add to the sweetness and richness of the dish.</p></h4>

    <p><h3>Ingredients</h3></p>
    <ul>
      <p><strong>For the chicken and marinade:</strong></p>
      <li>1 pound boneless, skinless chicken thighs, cut into roughly 1-inch cubes</li>
      <li>1/4 cup full-fat plain yogurt</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon ginger garlic paste</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground coriander</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Kashmiri Lal Mirch</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon cumin</li>
      <li>Salt to taste</li>

      <p><strong>For the sauce:</strong></p>
      <li>8 to 10 whole almonds and cashews</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter, divided</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon ginger garlic paste</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
      <li>1 (15-ounce) can diced tomatoes</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons dried coriander</li>
      <li>1 1/2 teaspoons ground garam masala</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1 cup water</li>
      <li>1/4 cup heavy cream</li>
    </ul>

  <p><h3>Steps</h3></p>
    <ol>
      <li><h4>Marinate the chicken:</h4> <!--Step 1-->
      Bring the chicken and the rest of the marinade ingredients together in a
      large bowl. Using your hands, massage the marinade into the chicken.
      <p>Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour, or up to
      overnight.</p></li>

      <li><h4>Soak cashews and almonds:</h4> <!--Step 2-->
      Soak cashews and almonds in water for at least an hour to (or up to overnight)
      before preparing the rest of the recipe.</li>

      <li><h4>Cook the chicken:</h4> <!--Step 3-->
      Heat a skillet or grill pan over medium-high heat. Drizzle a teaspoon of
      oil to the pan.
      <p>Working in batches, remove chicken from the marinade and grill them on
      the pan for 3 to 5 minutes on each side, until the chicken is cooked
      through (clear juice runs out of it when you cut into it). Do not crowd
      the pan.</p></li>

      <li><h4>Start making the sauce:</h4> <!--Step 4-->
      Melt 1 1/2 tablespoons of the butter in a medium sized Dutch oven or a skillet
      on medium low heat. As soon as the butter melts, add the ginger garlic paste
      followed by sugar. Saut√© for 1 to 2 minutes.
      <p>Stir in the tomato and cook for 8 to 10 minutes on medium high heat, until
      all the extra liquid is cooked off. The sauce should be a loose, paste-like
      consistency.</p>Add coriander, garam masala, Kashmiri Lal Mirch, and salt.
      Stir and cook on medium heat for 2 to 3 minutes. Turn off the heat.</li>

      <li><h4>Puree the sauce with the nuts:</h4> <!--Step 5-->
      Transfer the paste to a blender or the bowl of a food processor. Add the
      soaked cashews and almonds. Blend into a smooth paste.</li>

      <li><h4>Finish the dish:</h4> <!--Step 6-->
      Return the paste to the cooking pan over medium heat. Add the water to the
      paste and stir to make a smooth sauce.
      <p>As the sauce begins to boil, add the grilled chicken and heavy cream.
      Stir well. Cover the pan and simmer for 5 minutes.</p></li>

      <li><h4>Rest the butter chicken:</h4> <!--Step 7-->
      Turn off the heat and uncover the pan. Stir in the remaining 1/2 tablespoon
      butter and the kasuri methi. Cover again, and let the dish rest for 8 to 10
      minutes so the flavor of kasuri methi can marry into the butter chicken.</li>

      <li><h4>Serve:</h4> <!--Step 8-->
      Serve the butter with a side of steamed basmati rice, roti, or naan. Leftovers
      will keep refrigerated, covered, for five days.</li>
